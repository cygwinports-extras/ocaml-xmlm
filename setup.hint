ldesc: "Xmlm is an OCaml module for streaming XML input/output. It aims
at making XML processing robust and painless. The streaming interface
can process documents without building an in-memory representation. It
lets the programmer translate its data structures to XML documents and
vice-versa. Functions are provided to easily transform arborescent
data structures to/from XML documents."
